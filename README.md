"# slack_prankster" 

## What?
Now it is possible to change sound notifications to any sound you'd like on slack.
We are not prone to the good will of future slack developers anymore. We can use ANY sound we'd like (windows XP startup sound - here we go!)

![slack change notifs](https://i.ibb.co/gwbJ0TY/slack-notifs.png)

## How

By specifically appending something to the Client (Electron) code of Slack. <br>  Don't worry, you can see everything we'll add by going over the source code.
The *payload.txt* file is what we'll add to the source code.

## How  - more simple plz

Run
``
python prankster.py [optional_url_to_mp3_file]
``

Running without parameter will replace your notification sound with a sound which is very close to your heart. <br> Try it.

## Prerequisites
 * npm
 * python
 * Slack installed (hehe)
 
## How - the longer version
TBD

### Something doesn't work? 
Let us know

##### This is only for entrainment purposes. <br> Nobody was harmed during the process except for our own pride while debugging the script.
 
## Q & A

###Credits
During Covid we had too much time on our hands, so both [my little bro](https://il.linkedin.com/in/dolevpearl) and I worked on this
